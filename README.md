# Robot Rumble Typescript Starter

A simple starter config for writing [Robot Rumble](https://robotrumble.org/) bots in Typescript.

## Usage

1. Save your bots directly in the `src` directory.
2. Save any helper functions in a subdirectory! The top-level `src` directory is for bots only!
3. Run `yarn run build`
4. Your bots appear in the `dist/bots` folder! Magic!

## Types

The `types` folder has Typescript shims for Robot Rumble classes. Don't worry about the fact that they don't do
anything, they won't be included in the built files and Robot Rumble will provide real functionality.
